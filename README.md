Template files for boardgame countersheet extension for Inkscape https://github.com/lifelike/countersheetsextension

This repository will provide sample files and assets to create wargame counters in Inkscape. You will need a NATO symbol font file JZNATO-v11.otf for symbols. This font can be referenced in SVG using https://jzedwards.github.io/fonts/jznato-v11.otf
I also recommend the Google font Roboto for a good, predictable Sans Serif font close to the original (and expensive...) Univers.
