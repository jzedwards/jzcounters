# jzcounters
Template files for boardgame countersheet extension for Inkscape https://github.com/lifelike/countersheetsextension

This repository will provide sample files and assets to create wargame counters in Inkscape. You will need a NATO symbol font file JZNATO-v11.otf for symbols.
I also recommend the Google font Roboto for a good, predictable Sans Serif font close to the original (and expensive...) Univers.

For an intro, try the simple Kharkov files jzcounters-v20-kharkov-simple.svg and the source data file jzcounters-v20-kharkov-simple.csv
