Counter Sheet SVG images

These are designed to be used at 1/2" print size, and are (usually) 800x800px SVG (which would be equivalent 1600ppi)
Most are created in Illustrator and saved as individual artboards. Some are created from images using VectorMagic. 
Note that they are not defined at 1/2" size, as Illustrator assumes 72 pixels per inch, so a 1/2" image is only 36x36 when saved as an image, which is pretty rubbish. 
Confusingly, Inkscape uses 96ppi, but Affinity Designer can specify the ppi (well done Affinity).

Generic counters are typically in black only, with no background colour, and are prefixed bg_

If a counter is game specific they may be prefixed with a game name eg pandora_

There are *no* text fonts in these icons/counters, any text is converted to paths. If you don't know what a path is, you will struggle with SVG files see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths
