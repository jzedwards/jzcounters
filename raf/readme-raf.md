This folder contains reworked counter and card files for RAF, by West End games. These files require the Inkscape Countersheet Extension.
jzcounters-v20-ref.svg is a facsimile of the original, using simple white graphics on single colour backgrounds. We will soon post a rework of the alternative colour counters from boardgamegeek.com
(NB The original counters are 5/8", these are 1/2" for my 'SPI style' 240 counter die cut sheet.)
jzcards-v10-raf.svg provides the cards for the game on a 3x3 layout.

Folder 'counters' contains background graphics for each aircraft and some markers
